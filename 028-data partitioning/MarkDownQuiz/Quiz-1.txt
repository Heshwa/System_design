## Question 1
Who performs the rebalancing? Is it automatic or manual?
### Answer
There are two ways to perform rebalancing: automatic and manual. In **automatic rebalancing**, thereâ€™s no administrator. The system determines when to perform the partitions and when to move data from one node to another.
 
In **manual rebalancing**, the administrator determines when and how to perform the partitioning. Organizations perform rebalancing according to their needs. Some use automatic rebalancing, and some use manual.
