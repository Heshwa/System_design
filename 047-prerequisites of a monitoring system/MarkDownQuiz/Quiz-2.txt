## Question 1
Logging is the act of keeping records of events in a software system. How does it help in monitoring?
### Answer
In logging, the application servers log the information into the file. The information can be CPU usage, application-related information, and other relevant properties that we deem necessary to backtrace or debug a file when a problem is encountered. We can populate our metrics based on the values logged in the logs. 

Logs and metrics both help in monitoring a service. But this isnâ€™t always true since processing the log information takes time. In real time, we need to act swiftly for early detection of issues. So, logging is also one of the inputs of metrics. Logging is just a mechanism to collect information, and the monitoring system can use it for collecting necessary information.

Logging can also help to temporarily keep the data on a server to absorb any momentary data spikes or to decouple data generation and monitoring systems.

detection of issues like operational
insights, metrics are preferred. For debugging and knowing where the problem occurred when an alert is generated, logs are favored.

With metrics, we usually have an absolute value of a metric defined for a property e.g., count of concurrent requests made to a server. Metrics can be counters gauges or timers.
And we can use values logged in the file to populate the values of metrics too.
