## Question 1
Can you identify a hidden assumption in our calculations above?
### Answer
When we divided the daily user requests by the number of seconds in a day, we assumed that those requests were uniformly distributed over those seconds.

This raises the question if the above assumption is reasonable? Rarely will a service get such a nice, uniform distribution of requests.

Doing the above is a simple strategy; what we get can be considered a lower bound on the respective resource.
