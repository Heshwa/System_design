## Question 1
Letâ€™s consider a service hosting the dynamic and personalized website of a large news organization. Due to some unexpected events, such as 9/11, flash crowds are coming to the website to find out updates. It might be a situation where all the DAUs come in simultaneously.

Such a situation will clearly break our usual load assumptions. Can you think of some way to gracefully degrade the service to meet such an unexpected load?
### Answer
We can abandon per-user personalization for the time being because probably everyone cares about current events. Additionally, we can shift to a static-like website where content is pushed to CDN nodes and updated by the service when new updates come in.

Doing so makes each request/response fast, and users get their data from the CDN, which will have multiple edge nodes near the customers.

Service can also reduce the use of multimedia content or use it judiciously so the clients, whose networks might also be congested, could get the information in fewer bytes.

The strategy suggested above will help the website go through the excessive load.
