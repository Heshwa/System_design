## Question 1
Can you find another shortcoming in the design shown above?
### Answer
The #key# physical clocks: A device used to measure and indicate time, e.g., pendulums, hourglass, quartz clock, etc. #key# are unreliable. For such clocks, the error can be 17 seconds per day. If we measure time using these on a server, the time drifts away. 

Considering a single server, we won't be affected by the drifting away of time since all transactions land on a single server. But in a distributed environment, the clocks won't remain synced. 

Due to the unreliability of measuring accurate time, no matter how often we synchronize these clocks with each other or other clocks with accurate measurement methods, there will always be _skew_ between the various clocks involved in a distributed system.
