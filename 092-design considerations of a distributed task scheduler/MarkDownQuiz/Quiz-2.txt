## Question 1
How do we determine the value of delay tolerance?

### Answer
Since there are different categories of tasks in various applications, the application owners or clients can set or automate the values themselves, depending upon the task category. For example, in a social media application like Facebook, we can generate a newsfeed, suggest friends, allow users to mark themselves safe after a disaster, send notifications about a live stream event, and many more. Out of the listed tasks, the priority tasks should be to mark a person safe during an earthquake and send notifications about live stream events. Clients can tighten the delay tolerance values of these tasks down to milliseconds or a few seconds while tasks like suggesting friends can be delayed for days.

The task scheduling system itself can set the delay tolerance value depending on the task category and its severity.

There are different costs for different priorities (there are usually higher costs for high-priority tasks, for example) so that customers can carefully categorize their tasks.
