## Question 1
What happens when the visibility timeout of a specific message expires and the consumer is still busy processing the message?
### Answer
The message becomes visible, and another worker can receive the message, thereby duplicating the processing. To avoid such a situation, we ensure that the application sets a safe threshold for visibility timeout.
