## Question 1
Why is there a custom routing layer between the web and application servers instead of a load-balancing layer?
### Answer
The primary reason is performance. A generic load-balancing layer will have little application understandability and higher latency.

As stated, the manager processes generate the skeleton of the web page and leave the majority of the work to worker processes. In that sense, one manager process can generate multiple worker tasks. The custom #key# router library: Quora refers to it as “Fastrouter”–it is a custom C++ built queue server.  #key# is a queue between manager and worker, where any worker process can consume a task generated by the manager process. 

This design improves the overall performance and supports scalability.
