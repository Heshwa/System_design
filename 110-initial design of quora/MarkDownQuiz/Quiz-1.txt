## Question 1
When would a service like Quora require a notifications feature?
### Answer
Quora will need a notification service in the following scenarios:
- A user posts a question on a topic subscribed by a would-be respondent.
- A user posts an answer to a question asked by another user.
- A post a user is interested in or wrote received new comments or upvotes/downvotes, and so on.

## Question 2
How is it possible for Quora to send notifications to users through the above-described mechanism?
### Answer
Since tasks are added to different priority queues, it is possible to maintain a queue for notifications. While higher priority tasks are enqueued to high-priority queues, a notification task will be added to a medium or lower priority queue. The illustration below visualizes the described concept:
