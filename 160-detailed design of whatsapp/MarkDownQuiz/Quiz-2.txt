## Question 1
The data in the cache will become outdated if a user gets disconnected and connects with another server. Keeping this in mind, how long should a WebSocket server cache information?
### Answer
The information will be updated in the WebSocket manager when a user disconnects due to some faults in the connection and reconnects with a different WebSocket server. The WebSocket manager, in turn, invalidates the data in the cache used by the WebSocket servers, and the updated data is sent to the corresponding cache. So, the information in the cache will remain there until it receives an invalidate signal from the WebSocket manager.
