## Question 1
What happens when the primary node fails?
### Answer
In case of failure of the primary node, a secondary node can be appointed as a primary node, which speeds up the process of recovering the initial primary node. There are two approaches to select the new primary node: manual and automatic.

In a **manual approach**, an operator decides which node should be the primary node and notifies all secondary nodes.

In an **automatic approach**, when secondary nodes find out that the primary node has failed, they appoint the new primary node by conducting an election known as a #key# leader election: A leader is typically assigned based on a factor, such as choosing the processor with the highest identifier. #key#.
