## Question 1
How are DNS names processed? For example, will educative.io be processed from left to right or right to left?
### Answer
Unlike UNIX files, which are processed from left to right, DNS names are processed from right to left. In the case of educative.io, the resolvers will first resolve the `.io` part, then `educative`, and so on.

Visually, however, the DNS hierarchy can be viewed as a tree.
