## Question 1
To maintain high availability, should the TTL value be large or small?
### Answer
To maintain high availability, the TTL value should be small. This is because if any server or cluster fails, the organization can update the resource records right away. Users will experience non-availability only for the time the TTL isnâ€™t expired. However, if the TTL is large, the organization will update its resource records, whereas users will keep pinging the outdated server that would have crashed long ago. Companies that long for high availability maintain a TTL value as low as 120 seconds. Therefore, even in case of a failure, the maximum downtime is a few minutes.
