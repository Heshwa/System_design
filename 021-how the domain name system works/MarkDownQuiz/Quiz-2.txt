## Question 1
What happens if a network is congested? Should DNS continue using UDP?
### Answer
Typically, DNS uses UDP. However, DNS can use TCP when its message size exceeds the original packet size of 512 Bytes. This is because large-size packets are more prone to be damaged in congested networks. DNS always uses TCP for zone transfers.

Some clients prefer TCP over UDP to employ transport layer security for privacy reasons.
