## Question 2
**(Select all that apply.)** Why is it essential to store the information of routes in a ride-hailing service design?
### Options

1. It helps to optimize the ETA.
Correct
We have actual values with each route stored in the database. Next time someone chooses this route, we could give a more accurate ETA.
----------------------------

2. It minimizes the ride cost fluctuation.
Correct
We know the route detail by the ride details. So, the ETA estimation will be close to the actual time taken. That's why the initial cost estimate (decided earlier the ride) fluctuates less.

3. It helps to determine the bonus for the driver.
Incorrect
Saving the route detail does not affect the bonus. In contrast, the distance covered by the driver matters in bonus determination.

2. Driver and passenger profile details 
Correct
Names, driver photos, vehicle detail, etc., can store in the CDN.
