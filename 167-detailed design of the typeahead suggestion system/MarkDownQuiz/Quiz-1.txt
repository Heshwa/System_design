## Question 1
Should we collect data and build a trie per user, or should it be shared among all users?
### Answer
Since we aim to design a system on a scale that’s similar to Google Search, billions of users will be using our service. Since the number of users would be huge, maintaining a tree for each user would become complex and time-consuming. There’s also a possibility of duplicated trees if several users have typed some common searches, resulting in resource wastage.

Therefore, our design assumes a **common trie** that’s shared among users, where the ranking would be based on single phrases in the trie and the frequency of the terms.
