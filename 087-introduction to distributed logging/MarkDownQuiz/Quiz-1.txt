## Question 1
What is a scenario where the sampling approach will not work?
### Answer
Letâ€™s consider an application that processes a financial ATM transaction. It runs various services like fraud detection, expiration time checking, card validation, and many more. If we start to miss out logging of any service, we cannot identify an end-to-end flow that affects the debugging in case an error occurs. Using sampling, in this case, is not ideal and results in the loss of useful data.
