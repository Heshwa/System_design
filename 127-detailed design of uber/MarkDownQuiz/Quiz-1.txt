## Question 1
How will we handle a driver's slow and disconnecting network?
### Answer
We can use the driver’s phone as local storage and save the state of a trip every few seconds there. All requests and the last recorded state are stored on a local disk, which ensures that they’re preserved even if the application is restarted. Suppose the driver exits the application while there are a few requests waiting to be synchronized with the server. The requests and last known state are loaded from the local disk upon relaunch. When the driver relaunches the application, they remain in the same situation as before. The requests are queued in order to keep the server up to date.
