## Question 1
Can you think of a use case where sharded counters with the above-mentioned consistency model might not be suitable?
### Answer
We might not use shared counters with a relaxed consistency model where we need strong consistency. An example can be read-then-write scenarios where we first need to get the accurate value of something before deciding to modify it (actually, such a scenario will need transaction support).
