## Question 1
Instead of updating the whole page, we just need to update the suggested query in the search box in real time. What technique can we use for this purpose?
### Answer

We should update the query asynchronously using **AJAX**. **AJAX** is a set of web development techniques. It allows web pages to exchange a small amount of data, as in the typeahead suggestion system, with the server without interfering with the display and behaviors of the existing web page.
