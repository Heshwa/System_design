## Question 1
Previously, we said that popular content is sent to ISPs, IXPs, and CDNs. We’ve now discussed YouTube’s feature that recommends content. What is the difference between popular and recommended content on YouTube?
### Answer
Recommendations are specific to users’ profiles and interests, whereas popular content is recognized on a regional or global basis. It is possible to present popular content to the general audience.

## Question 2
Can you provide some formulaic representation of how the YouTube algorithm for popular content would work?
### Answer
To approximate a formula, we can assume a threshold value which is the weighted sum of all the considered factors like this:

>$$Th_{reg}  = Comments_{wt} \times Comments_{num}+  Likes_{wt}\times Likes_{num}+Links_{wt}\times Links_{num}
 \cdots$$

Where 
- $Th_{reg}$ is the number that will be used to decide whether a video is viral in a specific region.
- $Comments_{wt}$ is the weight of the comments.
- $Comments_{num}$ is the number of comments.
- $Likes_{wt}$ is the weight of likes.
- $Likes_{num}$ is the number of likes.
- $Links_{wt}$ is the weight of the links.
- $Links_{num}$ is the number of links.

The cumulative sum of each weight is equal to 1.

We may also assume that different threshold levels can be considered for different regions. Finally, we can consider a video to be globally popular if the sum of thresholds of different regions passes a global threshold value. YouTube may also decide to put some videos directly in CDN depending on the channel used to upload the videos.

## Question 3
In reference to Question 2, how often do you think that the approximation calculation for whether content is popular will be made? On each click, like, or comment?
### Answer
Calculation per click, like, or comment requires special infrastructure to perform calculations correctly and in real-time. This should be limited to:
- The most popular channels.
- Alternatively, a particular metric that triggers the computation every time it crosses a certain value. A good trigger could be an increasing number of requests made for a specific video in a shorter period of time.
