## Question 1
What are the shortcomings of the push approach?
### Answer
Consider an account that belongs to a celebrity, like Cristiano Ronaldo, who has over 400 million followers. So if he posts a photo or a video, we will push the links of the photo/video to 400 million+ users, which is inefficient.
