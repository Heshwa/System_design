## Question 1
If the prefix frequencies keep increasing over time, the corresponding integers storing them can overflow. How can we manage this issue?
### Answer
We can normalize frequencies by mapping them in a range, letâ€™s say between zero and 1,000. Alternatively, we can stop any further additions after a certain threshold is reached, assuming that any prefix reaching that threshold is at the top of the rankings.
