## Question 1
We reduced the time to traverse the trie by combining nodes with single branches and reducing the number of levels. Is there any other way to minimize the trie traversal time?
### Answer
One way to reduce the trie traversal time is to #key# pre-compute: Instead of traversing the tree each time, the system traverses the tree only once and stores the suggestions in each node which we call pre-computed suggestions. #key# and save the top ten (or any number of our choosing) suggestions for every prefix in the node. This means that instead of traversing the trie each time a user types in “UNIVERS” into the search box, the system will have precomputed, sorted, and stored the solution to the prefix `UNIVERS`—that is, `UNIVERSITY`, `UNIVERSAL`, and so on—inside the node that carries the prefix `UNIVERS`. However, this approach requires extra space to save precomputed results.
