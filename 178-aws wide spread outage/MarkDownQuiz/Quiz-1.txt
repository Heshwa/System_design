## Question 1
What can we do to safeguard against the series of faults experienced by Amazon?
### Answer
We suggest the following solutions:
* End-to-end transparency at each layer gives the information required to run the sites and services properly.

* Building an application across multiple clouds or AWS regions would have made it easier for the affected customers to recover quickly.

* There's a need to uncouple services to an extreme extent to eliminate cross-dependency issues.
