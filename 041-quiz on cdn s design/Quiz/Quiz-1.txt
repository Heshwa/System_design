## Question 1
Which CDN approach will be the most suitable to use when most of the web content is static?
### Options

1. Pull CDN
Incorrect
Use Pull CDN where web content changes frequently.
----------------------------

2. Push CDN
Correct
Use Push CDN where web content changes infrequently and caches in the edge proxy servers for a long period.
----------------------------

---------------------------------------------

## Question 2
**(Select all that apply.)** What are the limitations of using a public CDN?
### Options

1. An additional point of failure
Correct
The content hosted on CDN will not be available.
----------------------------

2. Risk of a data breach
Correct
There are always risks when third parties manage the data. 
----------------------------

3. Loss of control
Correct
When content publishes to the proxy servers, the CDN providers control it.
----------------------------

4. An additional DNS lookup
Correct
CDN network layer increases DNS lookup.
----------------------------

5. Increased latency
Incorrect
CDN is used to reduce the latency between end-users and the content. Therefore, this option can not be a limitation.
----------------------------

---------------------------------------------

## Question 3
**(Select all that apply.)** What are the main reasons for building a specialized CDN?
### Options

1. It optimizes the content delivery.
Correct
Specified CDN is dedicated to a particular content provider which optimizes the delivery of the requested content.
----------------------------

2. It helps us avoid the increasing cost of CDN providers.
Correct
The cost of CDN providers increases when we increase the cache size or add more components.
----------------------------

3. It prevents ISP intervention.
Incorrect
Each request comes through ISP using encrypted connections. So, ISPs can't intervene.
----------------------------

4. It reduces the hit ratio.
Incorrect
Specialized CDN will increase the hit ratio instead of reducing it because it is dedicated to particular content.
----------------------------

---------------------------------------------

## Question 4
Suppose youâ€™re asked to scale the Quora system to reduce the burden of data distribution on the origin server. Which technique will you use to do this?
### Options

1. A single-tier CDN
Incorrect
Single tier does not reduce the burden because an origin server has to distribute the content to all CDN servers.
----------------------------

2. A multi-tier CDN
Correct
Using this approach, data distribution is divided into the CDN layers like an origin to parent CDN servers and parent to the following layer CDN servers.
----------------------------

3. A public CDN
Incorrect
The origin server will need to provide data to CDN, be it public or private.
----------------------------

4. A multi CDN
Incorrect
A multi-CDN combines multiple CDNs from different CDN providers into a single network. Often such a strategy is complex and expensive.

----------------------------

---------------------------------------------

## Question 5
**(Select all that apply.)** Why do most websites use a CDN?


### Options

1. A CDN ensures improved scalability.
Correct
Horizontal scaling is not a problem for the CDN.
----------------------------

2. A CDN offers protection against DDoS attacks.
Correct
Scrubber servers are used to prevent DDoS attacks in the CDN network.
----------------------------

3. A CDN creates a backup for all the evicted content.
Incorrect
Content is deleted from all storage of the specified CDN servers for consistency in the eviction process.
----------------------------

4. A CDN reduces the load on the origin server.
Correct
CDN reduces the burden from the origin servers like data distribution, handling massive traffic, etc.
----------------------------

5. A CDN guarantees better performance.
Correct
CDN is placed near the end-user, so it increases the performance by reducing latency and speeding up the request/response process.
----------------------------

---------------------------------------------

## Question 6
Which metric pair is the most suitable for finding the nearest proxy servers?
### Options

1. Traffic load, caching capacity
Incorrect
Caching capacity is not a relevant factor, but Traffic load is.
----------------------------

2. Request load, network distance
Correct
This is the best suitable pair to find the nearest proxy server.  
----------------------------

3. Location, bandwidth
Incorrect
Location does not describe any details, but the distance between two locations does.
----------------------------

4. Caching capacity, network distance
Incorrect
Caching capacity is not a relevant factor, but network distance is. 
----------------------------
