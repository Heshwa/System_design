## Question 1
How does logging change when we host our service on a multi-tenant cloud (like AWS) versus when an organization has exclusive control of the infrastructure (like Facebook), specifically in terms of logs?

### Answer
Security might be one aspect that differs between multi-tenant and single-tenant settings. When we encrypt all logs and secure a logging service end-to-end, it does not come free, and has performance penalties. Additionally, strict separation of logs is required for a multi-tenant setting, while we can improve the storage and processing utilization for a single-tenant setting.

Let’s take the example of Meta’s Facebook. They have millions of machines that generate logs, and the size of the logs can be several petabytes per hour. So, each machine pushes its logs to a pub-sub system named Scribe. Scribe retains data for a few days and various other systems process the information residing in the **Scribe**. They store the logs in distributed storage also. Managing the logs can be application-specific.

On the other hand, for multi-tenancy, we need a separate instance of pub-sub per tenant (or per application) for strict separation of logs.
