## Question 1
What are the disadvantages of the above-proposed solution?
### Answer
Since the inverted index will be transferred to the replicas, this will introduce a transmission latency to copy the inverted index file because the size of the index file can be very large.

When the primary node receives new indexing operations, the inverted index file changes. Each replica needs to fetch the latest version of the file after a certain amount of indexing operations reaches a defined threshold.
 <!-- Let's have a look at a way to reduce indexing latency on replicas to sub-minute latency. -->
