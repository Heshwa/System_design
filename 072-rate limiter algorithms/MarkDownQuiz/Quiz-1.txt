## Question 1
Apart from permitting bursts, can the token bucket algorithm surpass the limit at the edges? 
### Answer
Yes, the token bucket algorithm can sometimes suffer from overrunning the limit at the edges, as demonstrated by the following example:

Consider a scenario with a bucket capacity equal to $3$, and the number of requests allowed per minute is also $3$. This yields a refill rate of $0.33$ minutes, which means that a new token will come every $0.33$ minute.

In the illustration below, three tokens have been accumulated at the end of the first minute. At the same time, a burst of requests arrives and consumes all three tokens, leaving the bucket empty. At the end of $1.33$ minutes (at a refill rate of $0.33$), a new token is added to the bucket. Simultaneously, a new request arrives and consumes the token. 

However, if we consider the duration from $0.66$ to $1.33$ minutes, we'll see that a total of four tokens have been consumed.

This example shows that the token bucket can surpass the limit at the edges.
