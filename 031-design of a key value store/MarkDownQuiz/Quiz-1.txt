## Question 1
Why do we need to run key-value stores on multiple servers?
### Answer
A single-node-based hash table can fall short due to one or more of the following reasons:

* No matter how big a server we get, this server canâ€™t meet data storage and query requirements.

* Failure of this one mega-server will result in service downtime for everyone.

So, key-value stores should use many servers to store and retrieve data.
