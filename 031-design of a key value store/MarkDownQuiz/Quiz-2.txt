## Question 1
We often keep hashes of the value (and at times, value + associated key) as metadata for data integrity checks. Should such a hash be taken after any data compression or encryption, or should it be taken before?
### Answer
The correct answer might depend on the specific application. Still, we can use hashes either before or after any compression or encryption. But weâ€™ll need to do that consistently for `put` and `get` operations.
