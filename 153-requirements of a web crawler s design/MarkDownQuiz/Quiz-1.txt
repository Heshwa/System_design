## Question 1
Where do we get these seed URLs from?
### Answer
There are two possible ways to create or gather seed URLs:
1. We can manually create them
2. We can scan the IP addresses for the presence of web servers


These seed URLs must be of good quality.

## Question 2
Why are good quality seed URLs important and what happens if the seed quality is not good?
### Answer
When we model WWW as a graph where URLs link one node to another, our goal is to discover as much of it as possible during the crawl.

Using a low-quality seed might limit the discovery to just a fraction of the WWW graph.

## Question 3
How do we select seed URLs for crawling?
### Answer
There are multiple approaches to selecting seed URLs. Some of them are:
- **Location-based**: We can have different seed URLs depending on the location of the crawler.
Category-based: Depending on the type of content we need to crawl, we can have various sets of seed URLs.
- **Popularity-based**: This is the most popular approach. It combines both the aforementioned approaches. It groups the seed URLs based on hot topics in a specific area.
