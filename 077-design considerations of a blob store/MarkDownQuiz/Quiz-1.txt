## Question 1
What if the blob size isn’t a multiple of our configured chunk size? How does the manager node know how many Bytes to read for the last chunk?
### Answer
If the blob size isn’t a multiple of the chunk size, the last chunk won’t be full.

The manager node also keeps the size of each blob to determine the number of Bytes to read for the last chunk.
