## Question 1
How can we further scale when our manager server hits its limits and we canâ€™t improve its computational abilities by vertical scaling?
### Answer
We can make two independent instances of our system. Each instance will have its own manager node and a set of data nodes. Deployment of a system similar to ours has been shown to scale up to a few petabytes. Therefore, making additional instances can help us scale further.

For further scaling inside a single instance, we need a new, more #key# complicated design: "Windows Azure Storage: A Highly Available Cloud Storage Service with Strong Consistency". #key#.
