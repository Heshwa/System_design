## Question 1
What would be considered a good approach for communication between different manager and worker processes within the service hosts?
### Answer
Two approaches are feasible for communication:
1. UNIX sockets
2. TCP connections

Sockets (Unix or TCP) allow data streaming between sender and receiver with appropriate flow control (and congestion control in the case of TCP). That means the sender and receiver can send variable-size data in a decoupled fashion.

Other interprocess communication techniques like shared memory may not be feasible because they require estimating the size of the required memory segment, which makes the participants more coupled. Also, it will not work across physical servers.

So, we prefer sockets due to their high decoupling, flow control, and ability to work for both single servers or over the network.

## Question 2
In our detailed design, we have employed Kafka to handle our view counter of answers. Why do you think we made this decision?
### Answer
Depending on the topic label, many users can view the response to a question at once. This can choke the servers. Instantaneous update of the view counter is also not an important product feature. Therefore, Kafka is suitable for handling these tasks.

Quora handles these tasks in two minutes or less.

Nonetheless, we can use sharded counters as an effective solution to the view counter problem.

## Question 3
What is the main advantage of using long polling instead of polling?
### Answer
Long polling transfers the control to the server side instead of the client, which has no information about the updates in content. If the server is in control, it can reply as soon as there is fresh content. As a result, it reduces the request load on itself. However, long polling is a resource-intensive solution because it keeps the connection persistent or alive for a longer period of time.

WebSockets are another low-latency solution with low overhead. However, WebSockets might be an overkill for the features offered by Quora.
