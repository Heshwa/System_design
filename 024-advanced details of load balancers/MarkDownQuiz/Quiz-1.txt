## Question 1
After a request reaches a back-end server, should the response be routed back through each tier of the load balancers?
### Answer
No, the server can send the response directly to the routers (tier-1 LBs) through tier-3 LBs, which can forward the response from the data center. Such a response is called **direct routing** (**DR**) or **direct server return** (**DSR**).

DR/DSR is typically used for non-HTTPS traffic because when TLS termination is involved, responses need to be encrypted before reaching the client, requiring them to pass back through the Layer 7 load balancer for encryption.

## Question 2
Why don't the servers directly send the response to the routers (tier-1 LBs) instead of tier-3 LBs?
### Answer
Tier-3 LBs maintain some state of connectionâ€”for example, SSL encryption/decryption. This is necessary to give clients a seamless experience.
---------------------------------------

## Question 3
According to you, which tier of LBs is more prone to bugs?
### Answer
Tier 3 has more complexity, which makes it more prone to bugs.
---------------------------------------

## Question 4
The image above shows a higher number of tier-3 load balancers than that of tier-2. What do you think is the reason for such a representation?
### Answer
Tier 3 performs application-specific analysis and substantially more sophisticated computations. Therefore, handling the same number of queries as tier 2 requires a higher number of machines. Furthermore, tier-3 LBs maintain the state of a large number of application servers, which may not be possible using the same number of LBs as tier 2.
