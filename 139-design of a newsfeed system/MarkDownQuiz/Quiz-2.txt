## Question 1
How is the newsfeed of the friends and followers updated when a user creates a new post?

### Answer
When a user, say Bob, creates a new post, it is stored in the post database and cache. In the next step, the **newsfeed generation service** generates a newsfeed for Bobâ€™s friends and followers, and the newsfeed cache is updated. The updated newsfeed is delivered to the corresponding users on the next page/screen refresh event.
