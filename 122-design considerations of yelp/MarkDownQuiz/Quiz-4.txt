## Question 1
How will the leader-follower approach help us in replication?
### Answer
We’ll have a single leader and two followers. The leader will have the QuadTree and it’ll handle all the write requests. It’ll update the followers about any change made to the QuadTrees synchronously, so there’ll be a chance of delay. The followers will handle all the read requests. In case a follower dies, we’ll choose another follower and replicate the data to it. If the leader is down, we‘ll choose any of the followers to step in as the leader. This way, we’ll be able to replicate our QuadTrees onto three servers.
