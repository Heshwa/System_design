## Question 1
Is there an alternative approach to find the neighboring segments?
### Answer
We can use the pointers of parent nodes to find the neighboring segments. In each node, we can keep a pointer that points towards the parent node. Every parent node has pointers to its children nodes, so we can use those to find the adjacent leaf nodes. We can extend our search by going up through the parent pointers.

In the following illustration, node `F` can find its neighboring node, `G`, by first going to the parent node, `B`, and then to `G`.
