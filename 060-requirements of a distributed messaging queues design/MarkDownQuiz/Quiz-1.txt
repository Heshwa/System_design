## Question 1
Can we extend the design of a single-server messaging queue to a distributed messaging queue?

### Answer
A single-server messaging queue has the following drawbacks:

1. **High latency:** As in the case of a single-server messaging queue, a producer or consumer acquires a lock to access the queue. Therefore, this mechanism becomes a bottleneck when many processes try to access the queue. This increases the latency of the service.

2. **Low availability:** Due to the lack of replication of the messaging queue, the producer and consumer process might be unable to access the queue in events of failure. This reduces the systemâ€™s availability and reliability.   

3. **Lack of durability:** Due to the absence of replication, the data in the queue might be lost in the event of a system failure.

4. **Scalability:** A single-server messaging queue can handle a limited number of messages, producers, and consumers. Therefore, it is not scalable.

To extend the design of a single-server messaging queue to a distributed messaging queue, we need to make extensive efforts to eliminate the drawbacks outlined above.
