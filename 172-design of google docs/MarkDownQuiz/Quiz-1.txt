## Question 1
Why should we use WebSockets instead of HTTP methods? Why are WebSockets optimal for this kind of communication?
### Answer
WebSockets offer us the following characteristics:
- They have a long-lasting connection between clients and servers. 
- They enable full-duplex communication. That is, we can simultaneously communicate from client to server and vice versa.
- There’s no overhead of HTTP request or response headers.

The lightweight nature of WebSockets reduces the latency and allows the server to push changes to clients as soon as they are available.

## Question 2
The design above depicts a microservices architecture instead of a monolithic one. Why is that suitable here?
### Answer
Microservices are preferred for the following reasons:

- Development is simpler and faster.
- Each service within the architecture is isolated. That is, failure of one service doesn’t produce a cascading effect.
- Different components may have different programming language requirements for various reasons. Microservices give the freedom of using different programming languages for different components.
- Because of microservices’ modular nature, it’s easy to scale and update services individually.

## Question 3
What queuing algorithm is best suited for the operations queue in the design above?
### Answer
First in, first out (FIFO) with strict ordering is best suited for the operations queue so that operations are performed in the order requested by the users.
